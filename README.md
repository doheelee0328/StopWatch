# Stopwatch

I created a stopwatch application using JavaScript and the DOM. This project allows users to interact with a timer that can be started, stopped, and reset. By using the DOM, I was able to manipulate HTML elements to update the display of the stopwatch as it runs. This project helped me to further develop my skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
